# data-analytics-portfolio
Thank you for visiting my data analytics portfolio. I'm excited to share the work and skills I've developed through hands-on experience in the field of data analysis. Over time, I have built a strong foundation in tools and technologies that are central to turning raw data into meaningful insights.

My journey in data analytics began with a curiosity about how data can drive smarter decisions. Since then, I‚Äôve developed practical experience in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization, across diverse projects and industries. I work extensively with SQL to extract and transform data efficiently. Python is my go-to tool for scripting, data manipulation, and creating visualizations using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

I also design interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau, translating complex data into clear, accessible insights for a variety of audiences. Excel remains a core tool in my workflow for quick data exploration, modeling, and reporting.

This portfolio presents a curated selection of my work, showcasing how I combine technical skills with analytical thinking to solve real-world problems. From identifying business trends to automating reporting processes, I take pride in crafting solutions that turn data into action. I‚Äôm always eager to learn more and take on new challenges in the ever-evolving field of analytics.

[Classic Models Sales Overview](https://github.com/CreaTer619/portfolio-projects/blob/main/Classic%20Models%20Sales%20Data.sql): 

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis skills, from data cleaning and transformation in SQL to dynamic, insight-driven visual storytelling in Power BI.

Starting with the Classic Models dataset, I performed extensive SQL-based data wrangling to ensure data integrity, normalize fields, and enhance query efficiency. After preparing the data model, I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover key business insights, including:

üõçÔ∏è Top-performing products by net profit

üåç Regional sales performance across markets

üë• Customer segmentation based on order patterns

üìà Monthly sales trends and growth analysis

The Power BI dashboard can be reviewed by following the [link](https://github.com/CreaTer619/portfolio-projects/blob/main/Sales%20Overview%20Classic%20Models.pbix).

[Financial Investment Data Analysis](https://github.com/CreaTer619/portfolio-projects/blob/main/Finance%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

This project analyzes investment preferences and behaviors across different age groups and genders, aiming to understand what influences individual investment decisions.

Key aspects of the analysis:

üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation: Processed and structured survey-based investment data for analysis.

üìà Demographic Analysis: Explored how age and gender influence investment choices such as stocks, mutual funds, real estate, fixed deposits, and gold.

üéØ Behavioral Insights: Identified key factors affecting investment decisions, including risk appetite, income level, and investment goals.

üìä Visualization: Used insightful plots (bar charts, pie charts, histograms) to highlight patterns and trends in financial preferences.

This project showcases data-driven insights into personal finance behavior and demographic trends using tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

[Netflix Dataset](https://github.com/CreaTer619/portfolio-projects/blob/main/Netflix%20Files.sql)

This project explores and visualizes a dataset containing Netflix's content library. With Excel, we complete the process of Data Cleaning and preparation followed by loading the dataset to fit inside SQL.

The [Power BI dashboard](https://github.com/CreaTer619/portfolio-projects/blob/main/Netflix%20Dataset.pbix) provides interactive insights into the platform‚Äôs movies and TV shows over time. Key highlights include:

Content Overview: A summary of total titles, broken down by type (Movie/TV Show), with trends over the years.

Genre & Country Analysis: Visualization of the most common genres and countries producing Netflix content.

Release Year Trends: Analysis of content distribution by release year and addition year to the platform.

Ratings & Duration Insights: Charts illustrating the distribution of content ratings (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13) and average duration of movies and shows.

[Cricket Stats Analysis](https://github.com/CreaTer619/portfolio-projects/blob/main/Cricket%20Stats%20Analysis.sql)

This project analyzes cricket player performance data using a structured pipeline. [Python](https://github.com/CreaTer619/portfolio-projects/blob/main/Import%20Cricket%20Data%20for%20SQL.py) was used to clean and preprocess raw cricket statistics, which were then inserted into a SQL database using libraries like pandas, numpy and, mysql.connector.

SQL queries were designed to extract key insights such as batting averages, strike rates, and format-based comparisons. The results were visualized in Power BI through [interactive dashboards](https://github.com/CreaTer619/portfolio-projects/blob/main/Cricket%20Stats%20Analysis.pbix), enabling dynamic exploration of player and team performance across different match formats.

This project showcases the integration of data engineering, analysis, and visualization tools to deliver meaningful sports analytics.

Dynamic Filtering: Slicers for filtering by country, type, and year to allow interactive exploration.

This project demonstrates data transformation, model building, and dashboard design skills using Power BI to deliver clear and engaging insights into streaming content trends.

[Titanic Survival Model](https://github.com/CreaTer619/portfolio-projects/blob/main/Titanic%20Suvival%20ML%20Project.ipynb)

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic, using data from the well-known Kaggle Titanic dataset.

Data Preprocessing:
The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy. Missing values were handled through imputation, categorical variables were encoded (e.g., Sex, Embarked), and relevant features were selected and scaled where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Statistical summaries and visualizations were used to explore correlations between features (e.g., age, fare, passenger class) and survival outcomes.

Model Development:
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest classifiers. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices on a held-out test set.

Outcome:
The final model achieved strong predictive performance and provided insights into key factors influencing survival, such as passenger class, gender, and age.

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation and highlights the practical application of classification algorithms in a real-world dataset.
