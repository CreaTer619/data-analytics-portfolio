# data-analytics-portfolio
Thank you for visiting my data analytics portfolio. I'm excited to share the work and skills I've developed through hands-on experience in the field of data analysis. Over time, I have built a strong foundation in tools and technologies that are central to turning raw data into meaningful insights.

My journey in data analytics began with a curiosity about how data can drive smarter decisions. Since then, I’ve developed practical experience in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization, across diverse projects and industries. I work extensively with SQL to extract and transform data efficiently. Python is my go-to tool for scripting, data manipulation, and creating visualizations using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

I also design interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau, translating complex data into clear, accessible insights for a variety of audiences. Excel remains a core tool in my workflow for quick data exploration, modeling, and reporting.

This portfolio presents a curated selection of my work, showcasing how I combine technical skills with analytical thinking to solve real-world problems. From identifying business trends to automating reporting processes, I take pride in crafting solutions that turn data into action. I’m always eager to learn more and take on new challenges in the ever-evolving field of analytics.
