# data-analytics-portfolio
I'm excited to share the skills and projects I've developed in data analytics through hands-on experience. Iâ€™m proficient in SQL for querying and transforming data, and I use Python for analysis, automation, and visualization. I also build interactive dashboards with Power BI and Tableau, and I rely on Excel for modeling and presentation tasks.
